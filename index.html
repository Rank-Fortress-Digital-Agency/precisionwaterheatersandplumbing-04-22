            Your water heater has been with you through thick and thin, heating
            your water for all those years. But now it's time to part ways and
            considers a replacement. Here are some reasons why you should
            replace your water heater - even if it's still working!
          </p>
          <div class="two-col">
            <div>
              <h2>It's old</h2>
              <p>
                Replacing an old water heater is a necessary task that many
                homeowners face at some point. While the process can be
                daunting, it's important to understand the benefits of a new
                water heater and why it might be the best option for your home.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the main reasons to replace an old water heater is
                because they often become less efficient over time. As your
                water heater gets older, it will require more and more energy to
                heat the same amount of water. This can lead to higher monthly
                bills and a greater impact on the environment. A new, more
                efficient water heater can help reduce those costs and make your
                home more environmentally friendly.
              </p>

            <div
              style="
                display: flex;
                flex-direction: column;
                justify-content: center;
              "

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Another reason to consider replacing your old water heater is
            safety. An outdated model may not have the same safety features as a
            newer one, which could put your home and family at risk. Newer
            <a

              >water heaters</a
            >
            often come with updated safety features, such as pressure relief
            valves and temperature-control devices, that can help prevent
            accidents.

          <h2>It's not very energy-efficient</h2>
          <p>
            Unnecessary energy waste is a really big problem. For example, water
            heaters account for about 10% of household electricity use in the
            United States. That’s pretty significant! And if you think that it’s
            not your responsibility to help out with America's energy problems,
            remember this: Your water heater is probably older than 20 years and
            needs to be replaced anyway. So why not replace it now? Let’s take a
            look at some of the reasons why replacing your old water heater
            could make sense for you.

              <h2>Your old water heater could be costing you money</h2>
              <p>
                <a
                  href="https://www.precisionwaterheatersandplumbing.com/why-is-a-water-heater-important"
                  >Water heaters</a
                >
                are one of the most expensive appliances in your home to
                operate. They typically cost more to operate than your
                refrigerator, clothes washer, and dryer combined! So if you have
                an old, inefficient water heater, it’s likely that it’s costing
                you a lot of money every month.
              </p>
              <p>
                Replacing your old water heater with a new, energy-efficient
                model could save you hundreds of dollars every year on your
                utility bills. In some cases, the savings can be even greater.
                For example, if you have an electric water heater, switching to
                a gas model could save you even more money.

          <h2>You're not getting enough hot water</h2>
          <p>
            When you turn on the tap, do you notice that it takes a while before
            the water feels warm? If so, then your heater might be on its last
            legs. And with winter fast approaching, now is a good time to start
            thinking about replacing it. There are many reasons why you want to
            replace your water heater instead of just repairing or servicing it:
            convenience (no more waiting for hot water), safety (a new unit will
            be up-to-date), and money savings (you'll save approximately $500
            over ten years). But there's something else that could persuade you
            to get rid of an old heater - air pollution. Old heaters use natural
            gas and oil which release harmful chemicals into the atmosphere when
            burned. Not only is this bad for the environment, but it's also bad
            for your health. If you have young children or elderly family
            members living with you, they're especially vulnerable to these
            toxins.

          <h2>There's water leaking from it</h2>
          <p>
            The water heater is a small but important part of your home. It
            heats the water that you use in your showers, dishwasher, washing
            machine, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Water heaters don't last forever, and eventually, they all will need
            to be replaced. If yours is starting to show signs of wear and tear,
            then it might be time to start shopping for a new one. A small leak
            might not seem like a big deal, but it can cause a lot of damage to
            your home. Water heaters are usually located in the basement or
            garage, and if they leak, then the water will pool on the floor and
            potentially damage any belongings that are stored there.
          </p>
